# Good first issues (drafts)

These are suggested small tasks to help new contributors get started. If you want, I can open these as issues in the repository.

1) Add Run-in-Colab badge and verify notebook loads

Description:
- Add a Colab badge to README that links to the main notebook in this repo. Verify the notebook opens and runs in Colab, and update requirements or environment.yml if additional packages are needed.

2) Add environment.yml and verify Binder launches

Description:
- Create a tested environment.yml (already added) and confirm Binder launches the notebook successfully. Fix any missing dependencies.

3) Add README demo image

Description:
- Create an `assets/` folder and add a screenshot or short GIF of the main plot. Update README to display `assets/demo.png`.
